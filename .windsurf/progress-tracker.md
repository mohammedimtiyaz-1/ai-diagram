# Progress Tracker: AI Design System Diagram Assistant

## Current Phase

**Phase 4 — AI Prompt Enhancement**

Phase started: 2026-05-08
Focus: Replace mock prompt enhancement with real OpenAI GPT-4o calls. Raw prompts become structured, useful enhanced prompts.

### Phase 1 — Project Setup
- [x] Next.js frontend initialized (TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router)
- [x] FastAPI backend initialized (Pydantic v2, Uvicorn, CORS)
- [x] Landing page (`/`) with project name, description, CTA
- [x] Workspace placeholder (`/workspace`) with split-panel layout
- [x] Health endpoint (`GET /health`) returning `{"status":"ok"}`
- [x] Environment files (`.env.example`) for both frontend and backend
- [x] Pydantic Settings class for backend config
- [x] Custom error classes (`AppError`, `ValidationError`, `EnhancementError`, `GenerationError`)
- [x] Backend test for health endpoint (pytest)
- [x] README with architecture summary, tech stack, setup instructions
- [x] Frontend builds successfully (`next build` passes)
- [x] Backend health check passes (TestClient)

### Phase 2 — Backend Core (Mock APIs)
- [x] Pydantic schemas defined (prompt, diagram, conversation, common)
- [x] DiagramProvider abstract base class (3 methods: generate, refine, export)
- [x] MermaidProvider stub with mock Mermaid diagram
- [x] ProviderRegistry factory pattern
- [x] PromptEnhancerService mock (returns structured EnhancementResult)
- [x] DiagramGeneratorService mock (orchestrates provider + versioning)
- [x] RefinementService mock (creates new versions on follow-up)
- [x] ExportService mock (Mermaid, JSON, enhanced-prompt, explanation formats)
- [x] ConversationService in-memory store
- [x] VersionService in-memory store
- [x] `POST /api/prompts/enhance` endpoint (mock)
- [x] `POST /api/diagrams/generate` endpoint (mock)
- [x] `POST /api/diagrams/refine` endpoint (mock)
- [x] `POST /api/diagrams/export` endpoint
- [x] `GET /api/conversations/{id}/versions` endpoint
- [x] All 5 API routes wired in `app/main.py`
- [x] 12 backend tests passing (schemas + endpoints)

### Phase 3 — Frontend Workspace Shell
- [x] Zustand installed + workspace store created (`stores/workspace.ts`)
- [x] API client module with typed fetch wrappers for all 5 endpoints (`lib/api.ts`)
- [x] PromptInput component: textarea, diagram type selector, submit, example chips
- [x] ConversationHistory component with user/assistant styled message bubbles
- [x] DiagramPreview component with dynamic `mermaid` import + client-side rendering
- [x] FollowUpInput component for refinement after first diagram
- [x] VersionHistory component showing diagram versions in sidebar
- [x] Workspace page fully wired: prompt → enhance API → show enhancement → generate API → render Mermaid
- [x] Refinement flow working: follow-up → refine API → updated diagram + new version
- [x] Loading states: spinner in header, disabled inputs during async ops
- [x] Error states: red banner + error message in conversation history
- [x] Landing page updated with example prompt chips
- [x] Frontend builds successfully with Mermaid dynamic import

## Next Tasks

### Immediate (Phase 4 — AI Prompt Enhancement)

1. **Create OpenAI client singleton** (`core/openai_client.py`)
2. **Create prompt enhancement template** with system prompt for design-system intent extraction
3. **Implement real `PromptEnhancerService.enhance()`** using GPT-4o with `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`
4. **Add retry logic** — 1 retry on failure, clear error on second failure
5. **Validate** enhanced prompts against 5 example inputs
6. **Update frontend** to display real enhanced prompts with entities, relationships, assumptions

## Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-05-08 | Product is design-system focused | Clear niche; better portfolio signal than generic tool |
| 2026-05-08 | Prompt enhancement is a first-class feature | Better diagrams; differentiator; shows AI orchestration |
| 2026-05-08 | Diagram provider must be pluggable | Start with Mermaid; allow Eraser/others later |
| 2026-05-08 | Mermaid is MVP provider | Simplest to implement; renderable in browser; exportable |
| 2026-05-08 | Chat-based refinement required | Core UX differentiator; iterative = more useful |
| 2026-05-08 | In-memory context for MVP | No DB needed; sufficient for portfolio demo |
| 2026-05-08 | Voice uses browser Web Speech API | Avoids backend STT complexity |
| 2026-05-08 | Desktop-first responsive (≥1024px) | Diagram work is desktop-centric |
| 2026-05-08 | No authentication for MVP | Reduces complexity; no persistent storage needed |
| 2026-05-08 | Next.js App Router + FastAPI | Modern fullstack; Python for AI; React for UI |
| 2026-05-08 | Zustand + TanStack Query | Zustand for client state; TanStack Query for server state |
| 2026-05-08 | OpenAI GPT-4o | Best structured JSON output; fast; cost-effective |
| 2026-05-08 | Pydantic v2 + Zod | Shared validation mental model; TypeScript inference |
| 2026-05-08 | Mermaid-first, React Flow future | Text-based rendering simpler; interactive editing later |
| 2026-05-08 | In-memory + localStorage MVP persistence | No DB setup; acceptable for portfolio/demo |
| 2026-05-08 | 10 implementation phases | Clear progression from setup → polish → docs |

## Open Questions

| Question | Options | Status | Decision Needed By |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| MVP renderer: Mermaid only or also React Flow? | Mermaid only / Both / React Flow only | Open | Before UI-006 |
| Voice: browser SpeechRecognition or backend STT? | Browser API / Backend Whisper | Decided: Browser | — |
| Diagram history: persist in DB or local state? | In-memory / localStorage / SQLite | Open | Before REFINE-003 |
| Should enhanced prompt require user approval before generation? | Auto-generate / Show preview + approve / Toggle | Open | Before UI-005 |
| Context window management for long conversations | Truncate / Summarize / Sliding window | Open | Before REFINE-002 |
